# ðŸš— Welcome to the Focus Group ðŸš—
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this focus group! The goal is to generate ideas that could be used collaboratively to create an ideal car. You're welcome to submit any ideas that you feel would be useful to you as a consumer. You're also invited to weigh in and review other users' ideas; this will help us get a feel for what is broadly appealing and should be the standard vs what might be a good optional add-on feature.

# Background
Tim Robinson's comedy series "I Think You Should Leave" has entirely consumed my life, and the only way to break the curse is to submit this glorified meme as a completed project.

# Thank you for participating!
